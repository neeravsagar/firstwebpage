<h2>This blog I write about the Sun's immense thermal power namely the solar power and uses of it.</h2>
            There are so many uses for sun light, which include:
<ol>
    <li>We get lighting during day time</li>
    <li>Drying clothes</li>
<li>Plants for the process of photosynthesis</li>
<li>Heat for making hot water as well cooking of food by solar products</li>
<li>For making salt from sea water</li>
<li>For satellites for their operations in the sky</li>
<li>In telecommunications</li>
<li>Generate electricity which is called solar energy</li>
<li>Calculator</li>
    </ol>

Solar power is stored in solar cells which converts light energy in to electrical energy. Solar cells are combined as photovoltaic cells as panels that can deliver enough electricity for varied applications, including housing, signals used in traffic regulations, street lighting, industries etc., The solar energy is also being studied in varied applications including flying airplanes, cars and further.

    We should encourage use of solar energy because it is non-conventional sources. As children we have good potential to use our imagination during the course of our studies utilising dream projects which could be useful in our future careers.</body></html>
